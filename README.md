# Any-keyboard-Double-Typing-Issue-Fix
## Issue Explained
It provides a solution for keyboards experiencing an issue, such as the G613 Logitech keyboard (and potentially other models),
where certain keys may intermittently register multiple keystrokes for a single key press. This problem arises when the keyboard
registers multiple keystrokes within a very brief time frame, even when the key is pressed only once. The script addresses this issue
by ensuring that subsequent keystrokes registered in a short time span are disregarded, resulting in the output of the key only for the
initial stroke. This solution can be applied to various keyboard models facing similar challenges.
